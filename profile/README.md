# Naftiko
Naftiko gives platform and integration teams a governed foundation to build, run, and evolve integrations that actually scale without the brittle glue code. We are currently building an open-source core that allows enterprises to define and deploy integrations around declarative, standards-based, and business aligned capabilities.

As of December 1st, we are beginning to build the following open-source solutions:

- **Capabilities** - Machine-readable, standards-based, YAML or JSON artifacts that allow you to declaratively deliver integrations.
- **Frameworks** - Create, test, and package capabilities into Docker images. Model-driven, IDE-native, and built for AI-assisted development.
- **Engines** - Executes integrations, enforces policy compliance, and ensures reliability with safeguards built in.

Our intent is to provide this open-source core, while commercializing the fabric that surrounds it:

- **Fabric** - The control plane for dashboards, observability, routing, and developer experience. All powered by open standards.

We are just getting started, and our GitHub organization is the launch pad. We will begin rolling out artifacts and code for you to get your hands on in the beginning of January 2026, but we'd love to get the conversations started today, and work to develop Naftiko out in the open as part of the community ecosystem already in motion around Linux, CNCF, and Apache foundations.
